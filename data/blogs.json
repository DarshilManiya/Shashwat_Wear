For import-export businesses, quality inconsistencies can mean costly returns, damaged reputation, and lost business opportunities.\n\n## The Quality Control Framework\n\nA robust quality control system operates at multiple stages of production:\n\n### Pre-Production Quality Checks\n\nBefore cutting a single piece of fabric, quality begins with:\n- Fabric inspection for defects and color consistency\n- Pattern verification and grading accuracy\n- Sample approval from the buyer\n\n### In-Process Quality Control\n\nDuring production, dedicated QC teams monitor:\n- Cutting accuracy and fabric utilization\n- Stitching quality and seam strength\n- Measurements at critical checkpoints\n- Color matching and print quality\n\n### Final Inspection\n\nBefore packing, every garment undergoes:\n- Complete visual inspection\n- Measurement verification against specifications\n- Functionality testing (zippers, buttons, closures)\n- Final finishing quality\n\n## International Standards We Follow\n\nOur quality processes align with:\n- ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems\n- Oeko-Tex Standard 100 for textile safety\n- AQL (Acceptable Quality Level) standards for sampling\n\n## Why This Matters for Import Partners\n\nConsistent quality means:\n- Fewer returns and claims\n- Reliable product standards for your markets\n- Stronger relationships with your retail partners\n- Sustainable business growth\n\nQuality is not an act, it's a habit—and at Shashwat Wear, it's built into every garment we produce.",
